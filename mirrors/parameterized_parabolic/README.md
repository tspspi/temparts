# Parameterizable parabolic mirror

## Base mirror: ```parabolic_base```

This is a simple parameterizable parabolic mirror.

## Mirror with screw mount: ```parabolic_screwmount```

The same mirror model (using the same configuration) with a simple screw
mount

## Simulation with screw mount

There is a (currently incomplete - not including the sample holder) parameterized
simulation that pulls design parameters from the other models for the screw mounted
parabolic mirror in ```parabolic_simulation```
